U.S. Professors salary during 2008-09
================
2005-02-21

I am at this time (Feb, 2025) in the process of applying to phd
programs, as well as figuring out what I would like to do in the future.
For people in the research track, becoming a professor seems to be at
the end of this route. Whenever people ask me about future plans, I
would say do research and teach, two major aspect of a professor’s life.

While I was browsing through the packages in R in search of the topic
for portfolio 2, I spotted this dataset about professors’ salary. I am
curious how much money professors earn back in 2008-09.

First, let’s load the package carData and the dataset Salaries.

``` r
library(carData)
library(tidyverse)
library(car)
prof <- Salaries
```

Next, let’s take a look at the dataset. Like the labs we do, how many
observations are there? What are the variables in this dataset?

``` r
nrow(prof)
```

    ## [1] 397

``` r
names(prof)
```

    ## [1] "rank"          "discipline"    "yrs.since.phd" "yrs.service"  
    ## [5] "sex"           "salary"

There are 397 observations, and 6 variables. Variables include the rank
of professors (i.e., assistant, associate, or prof), discipline these
professors are in (i.e., theoretical or applied), years since earning
PhD, years of being a professor, the sex of the professor (i.e., female
or male), and the nin-month salary in dollars.

Are males’ salary higher than females’?

``` r
prof %>% 
  filter(sex == "Male") %>% 
  summary()
```

    ##         rank     discipline yrs.since.phd    yrs.service        sex

First comment is that there were 358 male professors and only 39 female
professors. The mean salary for female was 101,002, whereas the mean
salary for male was 115,090. It was a 14,000 difference. Wow! Another
comment, I would be happy with this salary.  
I want to conduct a t-test to see if this difference is significant.
First, run a couple assumption testing. Before t-test, check normality
and equal variance. For test of normality, I consulted:
<https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/media/30585/download?attachment>.

``` r
#create two separate variables, male_salary and female_salary, in order to run assumption testing. 
male_salary <- prof %>% 
  filter(sex == "Male") %>% 
  pull(salary)
female_salary <- prof %>% 
  filter(sex == "Female") %>% 
  pull(salary)
#normality testing
shapiro.test(male_salary)
```

    ## 
    ##  Shapiro-Wilk normality test
    ## 
    ## data:  male_salary
    ## W = 0.95877, p-value = 1.735e-08

``` r
shapiro.test(female_salary)
```

    ## 
    ##  Shapiro-Wilk normality test
    ## 
    ## data:  female_salary
    ## W = 0.94665, p-value = 0.06339

``` r
#equal variance testing, first change the sex column into numeric
prof <- prof %>% 
  mutate(sex_numeric = ifelse(sex == "Male", 0, 1)) 
leveneTest(salary ~ sex, data = prof)
```

    ## Levene's Test for Homogeneity of Variance (center = median)
    ##        Df F value Pr(>F)
    ## group   1  0.8401 0.3599
    ##       395

The normality test showed that male’s is significant. This probably is
fine because male has a large sample size, so it’s very likely to be
significant. Female’s is normal distribution. In addition, we can assume
equal variance. Now, let’s run the t-test.

``` r
t.test(male_salary, female_salary, var.equal = TRUE)
```

    ## 
    ##  Two Sample t-test
    ## 
    ## data:  male_salary and female_salary
    ## t = 2.7817, df = 395, p-value = 0.005667
    ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
    ## 95 percent confidence interval:
    ##   4131.107 24044.910
    ## sample estimates:
    ## mean of x mean of y 
    ##  115090.4  101002.4

There is a significant difference between male and female professors.
