U.S. Professors salary during 2008-09
================
2005-02-21

I am at this time (Feb, 2025) in the process of applying to phd
programs, as well as figuring out what I would like to do in the future.
For people in the research track, becoming a professor seems to be at
the end of this route. Whenever people ask me about future plans, I
would say do research and teach, two major aspect of a professor’s life.

While I was browsing through the packages in R in search of the topic
for portfolio 2, I spotted this dataset about professors’ salary. I am
curious how much money professors earn back in 2008-09.

First, let’s load the package carData and the dataset Salaries.

``` r
library(carData)
salary <- Salaries
```
