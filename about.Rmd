### Intro

Hello, and welcome to my portfolio page! I appreciate you taking the time to explore my work. Each portfolio piece includes credits to some of the valuable sources I’ve learned from. There are countless resources available for learning R, and you can use it to create almost anything you envision. If R feels intimidating at first, don’t worry—take it one step at a time and enjoy the process. Let your curiosity be your guide!

### A little bit about me
I am currently a Master's student in psychology at Wake Forest University, specializing in developmental psychology. My research focuses on the relationship between culture and parental self-efficacy, exploring how cultural factors shape parents' confidence in their parenting abilities. I aspire to become a parenting researcher, dedicated to helping parents navigate stressors and providing evidence-based insights to support and enhance their parenting roles. Previously, I studied psychology and sociology at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Undergraduate years were fun and enlightening. I learned so much from my professors and peers.

In terms of hobbies, I like reading books and reflecting on the values behind the books. I also like watching movies, doing sports, building LEGOs, and listening to music. 

### Content of my portfolio
This page is created for a course as an assignment. However, our instructor was very supportive and cool with us exploring creative things using R. I try to think about or learn about cool things I can do with R. I hope to add more content even after this course, so have fun exploring!
